Linux kernel
============

There are several guides for kernel developers and users. These guides can
be rendered in a number of formats, like HTML and PDF. Please read
Documentation/admin-guide/README.rst first.

In order to build the documentation, use ``make htmldocs`` or
``make pdfdocs``.  The formatted documentation can also be read online at:

    https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/

There are various text files in the Documentation/ subdirectory,
several of them using the Restructured Text markup notation.

Please read the Documentation/process/changes.rst file, as it contains the
requirements for building and running the kernel, and information about
the problems which may result by upgrading your kernel.


Chnages to kernel
==============

Added Resource Monitoring and Limiting capability. Done this way, designed and implemented data structures for storing open files count and heap usage for each registered process,
where users register or deregister processes for tracking, user can fetch open files count and heap usage of each registered process, define heap usage and open files count limits for
registered processes, using newly defined system calls (register,deregister,fetch, resource_cap, resource_reset) and to update and enforce limit, hooks at following system calls are added:
brk, mmap, open, close.
